- 👋 Hi, I’m @danyk2099
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development, video games and comic books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code in Python, as well as Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JS projects, preferably JS and Angular ones, but I'm not limiting myself, so if there's something interesting, I'd be more than happy to join.
